# E-Commerce-Chatbot
This project uses LangChain to facilitate the integration of large language models with external data sources. It helps set up the document retriever and manage the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for generating responses based on user queries. The project is implemented as a chatbot designed to provide quick and accurate answers to frequently asked questions from an ecommerce dataset.
